Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized a directory .git is created. 
It is needed because it becomes a git repository and files inside it can be tracked with commit history.


Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area in an intermediatory step between working directory and git repository. 
It helps in commiting multiple files (may be related to a single commit) at once to the repository.
