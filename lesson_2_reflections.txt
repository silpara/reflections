Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It is needed because it becomes a git repository and files inside it can be tracked with commit history.


Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area in an intermediatory step between working directory and git repository. 
It helps in commiting multiple files (may be related to a single commit) at once to the repository.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
When one logical change has been made, add to the staging area files concerned with the logical change made.
And commit only these files related to the logical change.
Staging helps in grouping files related to a commit.
